      <h2>ingredients:</h2>

            <p><li>12 Jacob's cream crackers</li></p>
            <p><li>8 sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li></p>
            <p><li>500 g quality minced beef</li>
            <p><li>2 heaped tablespoons Dijon mustard , optional</li></p>
            <p><li>1 large free-range egg</li></p>
            <p><li>olive oil</li></p>
            <p><li>1 cos or round lettuce</li></p>
            <p><li>3 ripe tomatoes</li></p>
            <p><li>1 red onion</li></p>
            <p><li>3-4 gherkins</li></p>
            <p><li>6 slices of Cheddar cheese , optional</li></p>
            <p><li>6 quality burger buns</li></p>
        </un> 
      <h2>How to make:</h2>  
      <ol> 
        <li><p>Wrap the crackers in a tea towel and smash up until fine, breaking up any big bits with your hands, then tip into a large bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finely chop the parsley (stalks and all), then add to the bowl with the mustard (if using), and the minced beef.</p></li>
        <li><p>Crack the egg into the bowl, then add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>With clean hands, scrunch and mix everything up well. Divide into 6 and pat and mould each piece into a roundish shape, roughly 2cm thick.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the burgers onto a plate, drizzle with oil, then cover and place in the fridge until needed – this will help to firm them up.</p></li>
        <li><p>To cook the burgers, preheat a large griddle or frying pan for 4 minutes on a high heat, then turn the heat down to medium.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the burgers on the griddle or into the pan, then use a spatula to lightly press them down, making sure the burger is in full contact with the pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the burgers for 3 or 4 minutes on each side, depending on how you like them – you may need to work in batches.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, wash and dry a few small lettuce leaves, tearing up the larger ones. Slice the tomatoes, peel and finely slice the red onion, then slice the gherkins lengthways as finely as you can.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place all the veg toppings, and the cheese (if using) on a platter and put in the middle of the table with plates, cutlery, ketchup and drinks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once cooked, remove the burgers to a plate and carefully wipe the pan clean with a ball of kitchen paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Halve the burger buns and lightly toast them in the pan, then serve up.</p></li>
      </ol>
    <p>bon appetit!</p>
